# User_Agent-Suspicious_Monk
Animation in Pure CSS3 and HTML5, the animation uses the User Agent to change the background depending on the browser.

<p>For this animation I started from this project:
https://codepen.io/poziomq/pen/YGRdKG</p>

<p>The code is totally responsive and fits very well with every type of screen and device.<p>
  
 

</BR>
<h3>Browser Compatibility:</h3>
<p>Chrome, Opera, Mozilla, IE, safari, Edge and Netscape Navigator (lol!!!Obviously it's a joke)</p>


<p>Incredibly even Internet Explorer can read the code without any problem!</BR> (some say there is a hand of the reptilians...)</p>

</BR>

<p>the simply goal is that the animation changes background depending on the browser.</BR>
I used a simple function in the css file that uses the user agent to determine the browser </BR>
and select a different background depending on the browser used.</p>

<p>With Opera, Chrome and Safari the good facade of the monk opens up, </BR>
 but if you really want to know the truth about the monk, open it with mozilla...</BR>
 (or IE, but Mozilla is better!)</p>
